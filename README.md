# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Learning Journey

## Overview
Welcome to my DSA learning repository! Here, I'll be documenting my progress as I dive into advanced concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Current Focus
I'm currently exploring the fascinating world of **Trees** and **Graphs**. These fundamental data structures are crucial for any aspiring programmer or software engineer.

### Topics Covered
*   **Trees**:
    *   Tree Traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
    *   Tree Types (Binary Tree, AVL Tree, BST, etc.)
    *   Tree Operations (Insertion, Deletion, Searching)
*   **Graphs**:
    *   Graph Traversal (DFS, BFS)
    *   Graph Types (Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted)
    *   Graph Algorithms (Shortest Path, Minimum Spanning Tree, etc.)

## Goals
*   Understand the theoretical foundations of Trees and Graphs
*   Implement various Tree and Graph algorithms in code
*   Apply these data structures to real-world problems and projects

## Progress
*   Started exploring Trees and Graph concepts
*   Implemented basic Tree traversal algorithms
*   Currently learning advanced Graph algorithms

## Resources
*   [List any resources you're using, such as books, online courses, or tutorials]
